## **Profile** ##  
I am a fifth year student of General Medicine. I study at Siberian State Medical University. Nowadays, information technologies are used in medicine as well. Contemporary software products help doctors to prevent, diagnose and cure diseases faster. It inspired me to start learning to program. I enrolled in Rolling School course. My goal is to finish this course. I want to gain knowledge of front and back -end development. I have spent all my time studying medicine and IT. In the future I want to combine my knowledge of these fields. So I can develop new software products that will help doctors and patients. 

As a medical student I have got many skills. The most important is self-education. My strengths are patience, persistence, hard work, and positive thinking. I believe these qualities will lead me to success.
